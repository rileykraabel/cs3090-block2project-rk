This repository was made to hold creative content to be shared with others. It contains a useful piece of code that I want to share with others, and I want others to be allowed to add onto this document. 

What constitutes as 'useful code' is determined by the contributor, who is allowed to add to the repository as they wish.


-- License Information: --
I chose a MIT License to represent this code because I want it to be used by other developers. The goal of this program is to be useful and beneficial to anyone who may need to use it or override it to create a more specific implemenation for themselves or others. The MIT License was chosen as opposed to other licenses because it is generally accessible by all, and can be distributed or sold at the hands of other developers. The point of this program is to be very minimally restricted and encourage group work and development. The code is not going to be updated very frequently, so if there is a bug, it would be beneficial for other developers to have access to refactoring the program to patch said bug.
